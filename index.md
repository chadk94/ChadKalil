## Chad Kalil: Duke Masters student in Economics and Computation

Insert picture of me Here!

### About Me

I started my undergraduate career at the University of North Carolina where I completed a degree in Economics with my second major in Global and Environmental Studies and a minor in PPE (Politics, Philosophy and Economics). After that I worked for two years at IHS Markit in a pair of roles, finishing my time as a Stock Surveillance Analyst where I worked with IRO's in the tech space. Currently I am working on a Master's degree at Duke (but nonetheless Go Heels!) in Economics and Computation with the goal of working in a software engineering or data science job following graduation. Personally, I spend much of my free time reading books (any good fantasy or history recommendations appreciated), or playing and watching basketball or ultimate frisbee!
